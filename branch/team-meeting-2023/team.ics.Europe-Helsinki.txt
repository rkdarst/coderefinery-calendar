Subject:  Community teaching workshop
Start:    Tuesday, 21 June 2022, 13:00 EEST
Location: Online
Description:

It's dangerous to go alone, take each other!  Remote work has
transformed interactive teaching from something that exists in
one room to something that can be a community event.  While
online misses physical presence, by using the practices
CodeRefinery has developed, we can keep it reasonable interactive
and take advantage of a huge number of other benefits, such as
more collaboration, more ways to learn (for different needs), and
more large-scale interaction.

This mini-workshop will try to discuss (and demonstrate) some of
the best practices that CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org)
has learned during remote teaching, and provides a hands-on way
of getting some experience with them.  At only three hours, this
is more of a preview and discussion than an intensive training
event (and we hope to have a longer event sometime in mid-late
2022).

Description:

Work together to improve the Python for Scicomp course materials.
The winter 2022 Python for Scicomp is still fresh in our minds
and the feedback is handy. It's easy to postpone implementing
these to tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes and we end frantically
updating materials a few weeks before the course.

But this time it will be different! We will start with an informal
chat and planning session on Zoom and continue to work on our
favorite sections, or the sections we think need the most work.

Everyone is welcome. You don't need have tought the course. If
you have time to help with a few issues, your help is appreciated.
