      <h2>How to subscribe</h2>
      <p>
        You can subscribe to these calendars in your calendar program.  This
        will periodically import the events by polling the URL, so that you
        get updates (usually with a few hours of delay).  Most programs
        implement this as creating a new calendar which can be toggled on or
        off.  Right click on the link above, "Copy link", and then...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Google calendar: Other calendars (left sidebar) → "+" to add new →
          From URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outlook web: Add Calendar → Subscribe from web.
        </li>
        <li>
          Thunderbird: Left sidebar → Calendar → "+" to add new → On the
          network → This location doesn't require credentials → paste URL →
          (carry on). Please set to update infrequently.
         </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	Each of these methods creates a new calendar (that can be
	toggled on and off) separate from your primary one.  You can
	copy single events to your primary calendar by clicking on
	them, this will also mark your time as "busy" then.
      </p>
